Development Plan:

Moods are sorted into three groups: positive, neutral, and negative. 
Positive moods include: energetic, prideful, playful, gratitude
Neutral moods include: pensive, content, nostalgic, tired
Negative moods include: unhappy, worried, irritable

Gratitude is used as dialogue to pull from when responding to gifts
An NPC with gratitude mood might say "thanks for stopping by!" if a goodbye option is chosen to
close the UI without escaping

Have a simple integer between 0 and 10, goes up or down a stage based on successful or 
unsuccessful interactions. When crossing the threshold 3 or 6, change mood to random mood 
in the new mood group. 

3->4 means roll for neutral mood
6->7 means roll for positive mood

0,1,2,3 = negative
4,5,6 = neutral
7,8,9,10 = positive

Each mood will have its own base lines (let's try and go for about 10) plus 5 lines per job
and about 5 lines per personality to start with. This is an exception to the ordinary rule that
combinations of tables are done procedurally, but it is necessary because this is a good opportunity
for a lot of punch from relatively small changes. This will be a good section to expand later since 
it is exceptionally dynamic which suits the mod's philosophy. The goal of phase 1 is to create 
believable "actors."
